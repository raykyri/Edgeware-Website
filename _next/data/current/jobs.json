It benefits from an interest and passion in mathematics, game theory, and psychology.\n\nThis role will be responsible for financial and economic leadership in a blockchain-based economy.  Analytic, communicative, and  financial skills are necessary. We can teach the blockchain part, but competitive candidates will understand  concepts like staking, bonding curves, have a basic understanding of smart contract platforms and consensus algorithms.\n\n## Details\n\nThis role would be responsible for:\n\n- Modeling and communicating the token economics of our platform, and also produce research into economic strategy based on the fast-paced development of our industry.\n\n- Additionally, they would interface with our community of users, offering compelling suggestions and interaction on recommendations.\n\n- Providing financial oversight of our blockchain’s public treasury, as well as our DAO’s (think of it like a foundation entity) treasury. This will include asset management recommendations.\n\n- Work cross-functionally with legal thinkers, operational leads to produce general and nonspecific guidance to agents in our ecosystem.\n","data":{"title":"DAO Financial Strategist","role":"Edgeware Agency","published":true,"slug":"dao-financial-strategist"}},{"content":"\n## Role\n\nThe blockchain engineer role is a full-stack devops role.

It involves familiarising oneself with two different smart contracting environments and becoming proficient in developing, deploying, and communicating the &quot;how-to&quot;s of smart contracts in both EVM and WASM environments to developers within the Edgeware community. This engineer should become proficient in both using the web3js and PolkadotJS API for interacting with contracts on each respective contracting engine as well as learn the internals of each contracting engine to diagnose and determine low-level configurations for these systems.\n\nThis engineer (whether now or through training):\n\n- Should be able to run Edgeware blockchain and its testnets under various configurations.\n- Should be able to integrate pallet-evm, pallet-ethereum, and Frontier into a runtime and run local testnets.\n- Should be able to actively monitor changes to upstream contracts and EVM modules, Frontier, and any new projects that spin up around using EVM/WASM contracts on Substrate.\n- Should be able to develop technical solutions and tooling around EVM/WASM contracts, through integrating popular ethereum libraries with Edgeware or scripts for improving the developer experience of either contracting engine.\n- Should be able to answer high-level research questions and improve the configuration of both modules (gas prices, economics, etc.)\n\n## Details\n\nThe main areas of interest for this engineer are:\n\n- Track progress in both EVM/WASM work on Substrate and other projects and compile reports around large changes in their functionality.\n- Develop demos &amp; tutorials for popular and interesting smart contracts in both EVM and WASM contracting languages.\n- Propose and implement tooling for improving the developer experience.\n- Benchmark contracts on both contracting engines and write reports around the results.\n    - Reason about gas costs, storage costs, and the differences that manifest when deploying roughly similar contracts on each contracting engine\n- Research concepts and improvements to these contracting engines, around state rent, upgradability, and more.\n    - Write articles around these improvements.\n","data":{"title":"WASM/EVM Contract Engineer","role":"Edgeware Agency","published":true,"slug":"wasm-evm-contract-engineer"}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
